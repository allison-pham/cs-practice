'''9.4 Largest Number in a List (optional)
Lets practice iterating through a list. Given a list, find the largest number in a list.
Note, you can do max( L ) which will give you the largest value, but try iterating through the list instead and finding the largest number.

L = [3, 8, 1, 9, 44, 5, 0] calling function largest (L) should return 44.

def largest ( L ) :
   # TODO 
print  ("The largest number is", largest ( [3, 8, 1, 9, 44, 5, 0] ) )'''

# def largest ( L ) :
   # TODO  - return largest element in the list 

# print  ("The largest number is", largest ( [3, 8, 1, 9, 44, 5, 0] ) )
