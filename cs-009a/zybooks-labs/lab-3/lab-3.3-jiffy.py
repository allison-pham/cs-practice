'''7.3 LAB: A jiffy (optional)
In computer animation, a "jiffy" is commonly defined as 1/100th of a second. Define a function named jiffies_to_seconds that takes the number of "jiffies" as a parameter, and returns the number of seconds. Then, write a main program that reads the number of jiffies (float) as an input, calls function jiffies_to_seconds() with the input as argument, and outputs the number of seconds.

Output each floating-point value with three digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value:.3f}')
Ex: If the input is:
15.25

the output is:
0.152

The program must define and call the following function:
def jiffies_to_seconds(user_jiffies)'''

# Define your function here
# if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Type your code here. Your code must call the function.
