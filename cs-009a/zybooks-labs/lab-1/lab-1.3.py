'''2.3 LAB: Expression for calories burned during workout
The following equation estimates the average calories burned for a person when exercising, which is based on a scientific journal article (source):

Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output the average calories burned for a person.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'Calories: {calories:.2f} calories')

Ex: If the input is:
49
155
148
60

then the output is:
Calories: 736.21 calories'''

''' Calories = ((Age x 0.2757) + (Weight x 0.03295) + (Heart Rate x 1.0781) â€” 75.4991) x Time / 8.368 '''
age = float(input())
weight = float(input())
heart_rate = float(input())
time = float(input())

calories = ((age * 0.2757) + (weight * 0.03295) + (heart_rate * 1.0781) - 75.4991) * time / 8.368
print(f'Calories: {calories:.2f} calories')
