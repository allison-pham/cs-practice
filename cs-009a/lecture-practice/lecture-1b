#create a program that takes in 1 user input: square feet of a home.
#This program should output the price of how much this home is worth by location.

#Riverside: $367
#Los Angeles: $713
#San Diego: $710
sq_ft = input("What is the square feet of your home?")

# Error: need to cast
riverside = int(sq_ft) * 367
los_angeles = int(sq_ft) * 713
san_diego = int(sq_ft) * 710

print(f"Riverside: ${riverside}")

# Answer
'''square_feet = float(input("What is the square feet of your home?"))
