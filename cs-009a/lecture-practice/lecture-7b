# Answer for Translator
#Given a dictionary that has the English word as a string key & the Spanish word as the string value
#Output all key value pairs as "englishWord = spanishWord"

englishToSpanish = {}

englishToSpanish['Hello'] = 'Hola'
englishToSpanish['How are you'] = 'Como estas'
englishToSpanish['Avocado'] = 'Palta'
englishToSpanish['Cat'] = 'Gato'

for key in englishToSpanish: #By default, it goes through every key (meaning you don't need to call keys())
    print(f"{key} = {englishToSpanish.get(key)}")
    #get() gets the value associated with the key

    #Alice Baker: Redlands, San Diego,
#Keys must be immutable (non-changing)
