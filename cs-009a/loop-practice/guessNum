#6) Problem (Guess the number) : We probably have all played this game, were one person thinks
#of a number in a given range, and the other person tried to guess that number. If their guess is
#too high, then they are told their guess is too high and they can try again. Alternatively, if their
#guess is too low, then they are told their guess is too low and they can try again. These steps
#repeat until they guess correctly.
#Rules –
#1. The computer should randomly generate an integer from 0 to 1000
#2. Ask the player to enter a guess between 0 to 1000
#3. Evaluation
#a. Guess too high, print out “Guess is too high, try again”
#b. Guess too low, print out “Guess is too low, try again”
#c. Guess is correct, print out “YES, that’s correct”
import random
def guessNum(guess):
    print("Guess a random number between 0 and 1,000.")
    randomNum = random.randint(0, 1001)

    while guess != randomNum:
        if guess > randomNum:
            tryAgain = int(input("Guess is too high. Try again."))
        elif guess < randomNum:
            tryAgain = input("Guess is too low. Try again.")
        else:
            print("YES, that's correct.")
