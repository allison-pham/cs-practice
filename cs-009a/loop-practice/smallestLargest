#2) Problem (smallest and largest number in the list) : Write a function called smallestLargest(
#numList ) that receives a list of numbers and prints the smallest and largest value.
def smallestLargest(numList): 
    if not numList: #If list is empty
        return None
    
    smallest = largest = numList[0] #Assign multiple variables to one value
    
    for i in numList:
        if i < smallest:
            smallest = i
            
        elif i > largest:
            largest = i
    
    return smallest, largest

nums = [3, 5, 7, 3]
print(smallestLargest(nums)) #Call the function
