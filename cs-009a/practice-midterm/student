#12) (20 points) Write a program that continuously asks the user if they want to add a student to the
#roster, change a student’s grade, or quit the program.
#a. If the user inputs “add”: the program should take in a student’s name & their grade as
#input.
#b. If the user inputs “change”: the program should ask for a students’ name and output their
#current grade. Then, the program should ask for their new grade.
#c. If the user inputs “quit”: the program should quit.
#The program should output a list of students and their grades every time before asking for input.
#Your output should closely match the example on the next page.
